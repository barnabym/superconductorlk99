    <h1>Timeline of LK-99 Superconductor</h1>
    <h2>1999</h2>
    <p>Sukbae Lee, Ji-Hoon Kim, and Young-Wan Kwon begin working on a room-temperature superconductor at Myongji University in South Korea.</p>
    <h2>2023</h2>
    <p>
        July 20: Young-Wan Kwon publishes a paper on LK-99, a substance he claims is a room-temperature superconductor.<br>
        July 21: Other scientists begin to replicate Kwon's results.<br>
        July 22: A Russian anime catgirl claims to have successfully replicated LK-99.<br>
        July 23: US, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian labs begin to replicate LK-99.<br>
        July 24: A journalist visits Kwon's lab and does not observe diamagnetism, which is a property of superconductors.<br>
        July 25: Kwon's lab releases a progress report stating that superconductivity was observed at 110K (-163.15Â°C).<br>
        July 26: Kwon's lab announces that they have begun synthesis of LK-99.<br>
        August 3: The current time.
    </p>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>If LK-99 is confirmed to be a room-temperature superconductor, it could revolutionize many industries, including energy, transportation, and computing. Further research is needed to determine the exact properties of LK-99 and to develop methods for large-scale production.</p>
